<p>Thank you again for coming today. Please listen to the instructions carefully. These will be read aloud by the experimenter, and you will be given time for asking questions.</p>
<p>All the people in this session will play the same games as you. The games are computer-based, meaning that all the interactions will take place via a computer network system. We will ask each of you to make different decisions. Your decisions as well as other participants’ decisions will be made in private, they will not be revealed, and no one will ever know the identity of the participants with whom they have interacted. To ensure anonymity, the session is set so that you cannot communicate with each other but only with the experimenter.</p>
<p>The games you will play recreate simplified versions of situations you or rural stakeholders might face in everyday life. There are no wrong or right decisions; therefore, we ask you to decide based exclusively on your preferences. You will receive {{ session.config.participation_fee }} to thank you for your participation, plus a sum which depends on the results of the games. During the games we work in {{ units }}. At the end of the last game today, your {{ units }} will be converted into {{ rate }}, and your total earnings will be communicated to you privately. Other participants will not know your total earnings.</p>
<p>Should you have any questions during the games, please ask us the <i>Host</i> using the video conference chat function, and the experimenter will answer your question for everyone. Do you have any questions?</p>
<p>Now please click ‘Next’.</p>
