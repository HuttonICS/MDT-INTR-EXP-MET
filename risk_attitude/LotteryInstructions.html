<p>Now we will play the first game. In this game you will be asked to make 10 decisions, one after the other in rows like this:</p>

<!-- should avoid repeating this CSS -->
<style>
.lottery{
border: 2px solid red;
border-radius:10px;
padding:0px;
width:8.3em;
height:3.4em;
text-align:center;
vertical-align:baseline;
}
</style>

<table class="table">
  <thead>
    <th>Lottery A</th><th>Lottery B</th>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <td>
      <div class="lottery"><p>ðŸ”´ ðŸ”´ ðŸ”´ âšª âšª<br />âšª âšª âšª âšª âšª</p></div>
      <p>ðŸ”´ = {{ C.PAYOFF_RED_A }}, âšª = {{ C.PAYOFF_WHITE_A }} points</p>
    </td>
    <td>
      <div class="lottery"><p>ðŸ”´ ðŸ”´ ðŸ”´ âšª âšª<br />âšª âšª âšª âšª âšª</p></div>
    <p>ðŸ”´ = {{ C.PAYOFF_RED_B }}, âšª = {{ C.PAYOFF_WHITE_B }} points</p>
    </td>
  </tbody>
</table>
<p>In each decision a red or white ball will be drawn randomly from the 10 balls shown, and the colour determines the number of points awarded. In this example there are 3 red and 7 white balls.</p>
<p>Your task is to decide between two alternative lotteries, A and B. In this example, in both lotteries, you have 3 chances out of ten to draw a red ball and 7 chances out of ten to draw a white ball. The lotteries differ in the number of points that can be won in each of them: in lottery A the red ball is worth {{ C.PAYOFF_RED_A }} and the white ball is worth {{ C.PAYOFF_WHITE_A }}, while in lottery B, the red ball is worth more ({{ C.PAYOFF_RED_B }} points), while the white ball is worth less ({{ C.PAYOFF_WHITE_B }} points).</p>
<p>You will have to make 10 decisions. In all 10 decisions, the red ball will always be worth {{ C.PAYOFF_RED_A }} in lottery A and {{ C.PAYOFF_RED_B }} points in lottery B, while the white ball will always be worth {{ C.PAYOFF_WHITE_A }} points in lottery A and {{ C.PAYOFF_WHITE_B }} points in lottery B.</p>
<p>What will differ in the 10 decisions you will have to make is that there will be more and more red balls in the lotteries, so the chances of drawing a red or white ball out of the 10 balls will be different.</p>
<p>At the end of the session today, the computer will randomly select one of the 10 decisions to execute for real. The other nine decisions will be ignored, and you will not get any money from them. Each of the 10 decisions is equally likely to be selected. After selecting a decision, the computer will draw a virtual ball from your selected lottery (A or B) for that decision, and you will be paid accordingly.</p>
