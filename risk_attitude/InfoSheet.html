<h2>Why are we implementing this online workshop?</h2>
<p>  
This online workshop aims to introduce experimental methods in economics to all Hutton employees by making you play real, incentivised economic experiments. This will hopefully lead to many fruitful collaborations in future interdisciplinary projects involving a social science (behavioural) component.</p>
<h2>What are ‘economic experiments’?</h2>
<p>The use of experimental methods is becoming increasingly popular in social sciences, and especially in economics. These allow us to observe and better understand stakeholders’ decision-making and interactions in a controlled environment. In some economic experiments, participants are asked to play serious ‘games’ that mimic decisions they would make in everyday life. The specificity of incentivised economic experiments is that the decisions made by participants lead to real payments to them. While this is not the case for all types of economic experiments, financial incentive is required for the type of research being done in this study. This is because, if the choices made by participants affect the value of the payment they receive, their decisions in the experiments are closer to the ones they would make in real life, which have actual consequences on welfare. This is particularly important when individuals have to choose between immediate individual gains and longer-term common good, as in most resource- and land-related decisions.</p>
<h2>Why should I take part?</h2>
<p>The best way to appreciate the potential of incentivised economic experiments is to particpate in one of them. Furthermore, a larger sample would allow us to implement a more rigorous analysis. The results will be shared and discussed with you as well as with invited external speakers with an expertise in experimental economics, in the framework of a debriefing session before the end of the financial year (date to be communicated).</p>
<h2>Who will be involved?</h2>
<p>All Hutton employees and PhD students who will have previously expressed an interest in attending the experimental session (see details below). A debriefing session open to all Hutton researchers and employees, including those who did not attend the experimental session, will be organised in the framework of a future workshop.</p>
<h2>Approach</h2>
<p>The full economic experiments will be run online using the up-to-date, open source software oTree. You have been divided into two groups. Each group will be provided a link to the experimental page. A member of the experimental team will guide you through the whole session, reading the instructions aloud. You will interact with other participants in your group, but you will not know each other’s identity. You will be asked to make a number of decisions. At the end of the economic experiments, you will be asked to fill in a short questionnaire. We expect the full experimental session to last about 30 minutes.</p>
<p>You will receive a payment whose amount depends on your decisions, others’ decisions, as well as on chance. We foresee an average payment of £25, including a participation fee of £5 which does not depend on your and others’ decisions and on chance. These will be paid within the following payslip. No one will know each other’s payments.
Your participation is entirely voluntary; you will be free to omit questions you do not want to answer or withdraw from the research for any reason, and at any point of the process. Note, however, that to process your payment we need your SID, which will be requested in the final questionnaire. Therefore, if you withdraw from the research before then, we will not be able to pay you. In turn, if you decide to omit other questions, this will not affect your final payment.</p>
<h2>Data confidentiality</h2>
<p>All data will be stored on secured devices and treated with full confidentiality. Responses will be anonymised; only general findings will be shared with the funder and other parties, and nothing in research outputs will be identifiable to you.</p>
<h2>Who to contact?</h2>
<p>This research project is led by a multidisciplinary team of researchers of the James Hutton Institute, including Simone Piras, Laure Kuhfuss, and Peter Cock.</p>
